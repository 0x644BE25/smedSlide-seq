# S. mediterranea Slide-seq

This repository contains the code neccessary to perform the analysis in _Stem cell regulation without a contact-dependent niche_ by Benham-Pyle, Mann, et al.

Starting data (gene expression matrices) is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE199348 EXCEPT for the bead metadata xlsx, which is pending update. In the meantime, the Supplementary_Table_4-bead_metadata.xlsx submitted with the manuscript is correct and should be substituted.

** NOTE: ** submitted bead metadata clusters are original+1 (because Seurat likes to start at 0 and R prefers 1).
